### Overview
---

Over the last 250 years of "success literature" (books, articles, and essays in fields such as self-improvement, popular psychology, and self-help considered to be the keys to successful living) written in the United States, research has revealed a very interesting and significant phenomenon: 

- The first 150 years of literature focused on **character development paradigm** as the foundation of success.

- The next 100 years focused on **personality development paradigm** as the foundation of success. 

Both the Character Paradigm and the Personality Paradigm are examples of social paradigms.  This remarkable paradigm shift from focusing on character to personality development as the means to success is contrasted in the table below:

| Character Focused Development                                | Personality Focused Development                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Principle based                                              | Technique and skill based                                    |
| Values integrating good moral values deep into one's nature  | Values integrating outward behaviours, appearances and charisma at a surface level into one's personality |
| Focused on taking responsibility for self                    | Focused on developing positive attitude and good public relations to get a specific outcome from others |
| Doesn't focus on tactics                                     | Focuses on tactics, sometimes including: manipulation and deception, faking interest in hobbies, intimidation, "power looks", etc. |
| Seeks long term change                                       | Seeks a solution now even if its a quick fix                 |
| Solves chronic problems by dealing with the roots            | Puts a band aid and aspirin that address acute problems temporarily, however chronic problems inevitably resurface. |
| What you see is what you get                                 | There is a duality between what you see, and what you get.   |
| Develops who you are (Identity)                              | Changes what you do (Behaviour), and how you think (Attitudes) |
| Has the ability to produce "Quantum Leaps" in our personal development (sometimes in an instant due to a paradigm shift which suddenly aligns us with fundamental natural laws and principles) | Typically can only produce "Minute/Temporary Changes" in our personal development, as the underlying conditions remain unchanged. |

### Character is Primary, Personality is Secondary

---

The elements of Personality Development Paradigm —personality growth, communication skill training, and education in the field of influence, charisma, strategies and positive thinking are all beneficial and sometimes essential for success.  But they are secondary, not primary traits.  

>  If I try to use human influence strategies and tactics of how to get other people to do what I want, to work better, to be more motivated, to like me and each other—while my character is fundamentally flawed, marked by duplicity and insincerity—then, **in the long run, I cannot be successful**. My duplicity will breed distrust, and everything I do—even using so-called good human relations techniques—will be perceived as manipulative. 

It simply makes no difference how good the rhetoric is or even how good the intentions are; if there is little or no trust, there is no foundation for permanent success. Only basic goodness gives life to technique.

In most one-shot or short-lived human interactions, you can use the Personality Paradigm to get by and to make favourable impressions through charm and skill and pretending to be interested in other people’s hobbies. You can pick up quick, easy techniques that may work in short-term situations. But secondary traits alone have no permanent worth in long-term relationships. Eventually, if there isn’t deep integrity and fundamental character strength, the challenges of life will cause true motives to surface and human relationship failure will replace short-term success.

Many people with secondary greatness—that is, social recognition for their talents—lack primary greatness or goodness in their character. Sooner or later, you’ll see this in every long-term relationship they have, whether it is with a business associate, a spouse, a friend, or a teenage child going through an identity crisis. It is character that communicates most eloquently. As Emerson once put it, “What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.” In the last analysis, what we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do. We all know it. There are people we trust absolutely because we know their character. Whether they’re eloquent or not, whether they have the human relations techniques or not, we trust them, and we work successfully with them.
