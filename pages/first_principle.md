### Axioms and Principles
---

##### Axioms

An **axiom** is an irreducible piece of truth; just as an atom is an irreducible piece of matter.  Therefore an axiom is the most fundamental and foundational truth that can be stated, and as such, serves as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.  Axioms are so evident or well-established, that they are accepted without controversy or question, and are understood by ordinary human reason without requiring proof.

Entire doctrines, theories, arguments, and principles rest their entire weight upon the unmovable and unshakeable bedrock of one or more axioms.

##### Principles

Within *moral law*, a principle is a guideline for human conduct.  Within *systems*, a principle reflects the designed purpose of that system, which if ignored would make the effective operation or intended use of the system impossible.  Within *science*, a principle reflects an unbreakable law, such as the principle of gravity.  

Principles are not practices. A practice is a specific activity or action. A practice that works in one circumstance will not necessarily work in another, as parents who have tried to raise a second child exactly like they did the first can readily attest. While practices are situationally specific, principles are deep, fundamental truths that have universal application. They apply to individuals, to marriages, to families, to private and public organizations of every kind. When these truths are internalized into habits, they empower people to create a wide variety of practices to deal with different situations.

Principles are not values. A gang of thieves can share values, but they are in violation of the universal principles of goodness.  Principles are reality. Values are paradigms. When we value correct principles, we have truthâ€”a knowledge of things as they are.

##### First Principles

**First principles** are principles which contain axioms, upon which other principles can be derived.

### The First Principle of Personal Development
---

This brings us to the first and most important principle of personal development:

> If you want to achieve your highest aspirations and overcome your greatest challenges (the pinnacle of self development), **identify and apply the principle or natural law that governs the desires and results you seek.** Ultimately, success in any endeavour is always derived from acting in harmony with the principles to which the success is tied.  

This is because the universe and human beings were designed by God, according to the design principles that He established.  

Therefore, if we go against these principles (the way they are intended to function), nothing will work as we planned, and we cannot be successful.  However, if we simply understand and then come into alignment with them, we will maximise our time and effort in pursuing those things.  

A great source of many of these principles for many areas of life is the Bible.
