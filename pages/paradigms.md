### What is a Paradigm?

The word **paradigm** comes from the Greek. It was originally a scientific term, and is more commonly used today to mean a model, theory, perception, assumption, or frame of reference. In the more general sense, it’s the way we “see” the world—not in terms of our visual sense of sight, but in terms of perceiving, understanding, interpreting.

A paradigm is not reality.  It is a theory, and explanation, or model of something else.  Just as a map is a model of real geography, a paradigm is a model of real life.  Therefore, if the creator of the paradigm makes an error when they form the paradigm, it will not be in alignment with reality.  

All people form and adopt paradigms throughout their lives whether they know it or not.  They do this using their past experience and the knowledge they've gained.  A paradigm becomes the "glasses" through which they view and filter and percieve reality.  Some people wear rose colored glasses, other wear dark sunglasses, others wear very clear eye glasses.  Some wear blindfolds.  

Your paradigms truly are the biggest determining factor of "your reality", which you choose to live in.  The paradigms you choose to adopt are your choice, they can be consciously examined at any time and either kept, discarded, modified, or replaced, just as one can change the glasses they are wearing.  

> If you choose to change your paradigm, this is called a *"paradigm shift"*.

### Paradigm Shifts are Necessary for the First Principle of Personal Development

If your paradigms are false and distort your view of reality, it doesn't matter how much you behave in a certain way or how positive of an attitude you try to develop, you will simply not be able to come into alignment with the natural laws and principles which govern the area of reality in which you seek to achieve your highest aspirations, because you won't even be able to identify and see the way in which they work.  This means unless you choose to adopt a paradigm shift that allows you to percieve reality properly, you will be in violation with the very principles which govern your success, and your attitudes and behaviours will prevent you from reaching your personal development goals.  We can try and try and try to change our outward attitudes and behaviours but it will do little good in the long run if we fail to examine the basic paradigms from which those attitudes and behaviours flow.

A paradigm shift can occur if you are open and willing to admit that your current paradigm may be flawed, and you are ready to put in the effort of finding the correct paradigm and acting on it.  

Many people experience a similar fundamental shift in thinking when they face a life-threatening crisis and suddenly see their priorities in a different light, or when they suddenly step into a new role, such as that of husband or wife, parent or grandparent, manager or leader.

We could spend weeks, months, even years laboring with the Personality Ethic trying to change our attitudes and behaviors and not even begin to approach the phenomenon of change that occurs spontaneously when we see things differently.

It becomes obvious that if we want to make relatively minor changes in our lives, we can perhaps appropriately focus on our attitudes and behaviors. But if we want to make significant, quantum change, we need to work on shifting our basic paradigms.

In the words of Thoreau, 

> “For every thousand hacking at the leaves of evil, there is one striking at the root.” 

We can only achieve quantum improvements in our lives as we quit hacking at the leaves of attitude and behavior and get to work on the root, the paradigms from which our attitudes
and behaviors flow.

Of course, not all paradigm shifts are instantaneous.  However, the power of a paradigm shift is the essential power of quantum change, whether that shift is an instantaneous or a slow and deliberate process.
