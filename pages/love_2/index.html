As we read them, we are teleported outside of time and we have the incredible privilege of gazing upon one of the most ancient and timeless artifacts in the universe: the love God has for God within the Trinity. These precious verses are found in the Gospels.</p><h3 id="1-the-fathers-love-for-jesus">1. The Father’s Love for Jesus</h3><hr /><p>Jesus the Son of God, the Word who became flesh and dwelt among us, opened His mouth to speak words that had never been heard in all the history of mankind, words that revealed for the first time what perfect love looks like:</p><blockquote><p>“I and the Father are One.. the Father is in Me, and I in Him.” (John 10:30, 38)</p><p><strong>All things</strong> that the Father has are Mine. (John 16:15)</p><p>The Father loves the Son, and has <strong>given</strong> all things into His hand. (John 3:35)</p><p>For the Father loves the Son, and <strong>shows</strong> Him all things that He Himself does. (John 5:20)</p><p>For the Father judges no one, but has <strong>committed</strong> all judgment to the Son, that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. (John 5:22-23)</p><p>For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has <strong>granted</strong> the Son to have life in Himself, and has <strong>given Him authority</strong> to execute judgment also. (John 5:26-27)</p></blockquote><p>God’s love for Jesus had a common theme: God the Father didn’t withhold anything from His Son Jesus. Jesus clearly states that nothing was held back from Him by His Father, “For the Father loves the Son” and gave Him “all things”. He didn’t ration or portion His love, He gave Him everything all at once. He didn’t have to progressively earn favor and merits and rights and privileges. Jesus had everything right from the start.</p><p>Even before Jesus started His ministry, He knew He already had His Father’s love and approval. It wasn’t based on what He had done, because He hadn’t even done one miracle yet:</p><blockquote><p>Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” (Luke 3:21-22)</p></blockquote><p>Before Jesus even started his ministry, God the Father affirmed Jesus and gave Him the ultimate gift of the Holy Spirit, and with a booming voice that everyone could hear told Him that He was His beloved Son. This is lavishing love that comes from the heart of a Father.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The signature mark of the Father's love for Jesus was unconditionally lavishing upon Him all of Himself, His possessions, His knowledge, revelation, everything. Pure and unrestrained, unconditional love.</code></p><h3 id="2-jesuss-love-for-the-father">2. Jesus’s Love for the Father</h3><hr /><p>Jesus didn’t love His Father passively. He was fiercely loyal in His obedience to Him, and His desire that was that the world would know that He loved His Father.</p><blockquote><p>“Therefore My Father loves Me, because <strong>I lay down My life</strong>.” (John 10:17)</p><p>“But <strong>I do as the Father has commanded me</strong>, so that the world may know that I love the Father.” (John 14:31)</p><p>“As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love. (John 15:9-10)</p></blockquote><p>We see that Jesus also had no limitations on His love for the Father. Even a brutal whipping, beating, and death on a cross was not enough to even test the limit of what the Son was willing to do for His Father. Jesus’ expression of love back to His Father was complete obedience and sacrifice.</p><p>Jesus wanted the whole world to know that He was dependent on His Father for every single thing He did and He said. That He obeyed His Father in every single aspect of His will. He even stated that He could do nothing of Himself. Jesus imitated His Father, almost like His Father was His hero, His only source of guidance and strength.</p><blockquote><p>Then Jesus answered and said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner. (John 5:19)</p><p>The works which the Father has given Me to accomplish —the very works that I do.. (John 5:36)I speak what I have seen with My Father (John 8:38)</p><p>For I have not spoken on My own authority; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak. Whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so I speak.” (John 12:49-50)</p><p>The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does His works. (John 14:10)</p></blockquote><p>Jesus was focused on pleasing His Father more than pleasing Himself. This is more than just outward obedience or sacrifice to His Father’s commandments. A son may do whatever a father tells him, but a more loyal and loving son will not wait to be told, but study to find out what is pleasing to his father and anticipate the expression of his will. To know what was pleasing to the Father was Jesus Christ’s constant study; to do these things was his unvarying practice.</p><blockquote><p>Then Jesus said to them, “I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things, for I always do those things that please Him.” (John 8:28-29)</p></blockquote><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The signature mark of Jesus’ love for the Father was complete obedience and sacrifice. Jesus loves His Father by doing things that He wants Him to do for Him, no matter how hard or uncomfortable or painful they are.</code></p><h3 id="3--divine-exchange">3. Divine Exchange</h3><hr /><p>An amazing summary of this divine exchange of love between the Father and Son is given by the Apostle Paul, who says in Philipians 2:5,</p><blockquote><p>“In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>(Jesus’ sacrifice)</strong>: Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. (Phil 2:6-8)</p><p><strong>(Father’s response)</strong>: Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (Phil 2:9-11)</p></blockquote><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The complete obedience and sacrifice of Jesus led to the unlimited power and authority, fame, honor given generously by the Father.</code></p><hr /><p>go to Next Chapter –&gt;
