In this chapter, we will attempt to discover what divine perfect love looks like expressed in human form.  We will examine how the perfect model of love we saw in the first two chapters is played out on this earth.  We will attempt to boil love down to its essence, to its simplest form, so we can define what perfect human love is so that we can respond to God's invitation to participate in the divine love of the Trinity.   We will start with the outward expression and actions that were motivated by Jesus' love, in an attempt to discover his inner heart posture.

### 1. Obedience:  The Evidence of True Love

---

The Scriptures describe obedience as the litmus test of our love for God, because God desires us to love Him the same way Jesus loved Him. There is no other clearer evidence of love given in Scripture.

> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.  (1 John 5:2-3) 
>
> “If you love me, you will keep my commandments.” (John 14:15)
>
> “Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. (John 14:21)
>
> Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word…  Whoever does not love me does not keep my words.” (John 14:23-24)
>
> “You are my friends if you do what I command you.” (John 15:14)

And yet, obedience alone isn't true love.  When we see leaves blowing through the air, we know that the wind is holding them up in mid-air, but we don’t say that the leaves are the wind.  In the same way, obedience comes to life and swirls in the air around a person who has real Biblical love inside of them.   

There is an even higher expression of love.

### Sacrificial Obedience:  The Ultimate Expression of Love

---

Likely the greatest, most direct, easy to understand statment Jesus made about love was this:

> **Greater love has no one than this**, than to lay down one’s life for his friends. (John 15:13)

What Jesus is saying is that literally the greatest expression and fullest demonstration of love is complete sacrifice. **To Jesus, sacrifice was the greatest demonstration of love. The greater level of sacrifice you are willing to perform for a person, the greater love you have for them.**

Jesus later went on to practice what he had preached in John 15:13 when he demonstrated the ultimate sacrificial obedience in the garden of Gethsemane the night before he went to the cross:

>  “Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me;* *Nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.” (Luke 22:42)*

There is no question that sacrificial obedience is truly the highest expression of God's perfect love.

### Selflessness:  The Heart Posture of Love

---

If obedience and especially sacrificial obedience are the highest expressions of love, we need to get to the root of where they originate, and what causes them to be displayed.  They are simply outward displays of an inner reality, a heart posture, of real love.  

Obedience and sacrifice do come from the same root.  When we break down obedience and sacrifice into their basic elements, we see that they both share one thing in common:

> Obedience and surrender are **done for someone else**. 
>
> You cannot obey yourself, or sacrifice to yourself.   

At their core, they both require submission to the will of another.  Obedience can possibly be easy, but by definition, sacrifice must be hard or it wouldn’t be called a sacrifice.  

Another way to think of it is like currency.   The only difference between obedience and sacrifice is how much they cost you.  Sacrifice can be defined as obedience that has a high cost.  The greater the sacrifice, the greater the cost.  And the only way to pay the bill is if you have enough selflessness.  Selflessness is truly the currency of love.  If you do not have selflessness stored up in your heart, you cannot be obedient or sacrificial any more than you can buy a home if you don't have a job.

`Therefore, selflessness is the heart posture behind true love, the origin, the cause, and likely the truest definition of Biblical love that exists.`
