In this chapter, we will attempt to discover what God's divine perfect love that we learned about in Chapter 1 & 2 looks like expressed in human form, when brought down from heaven to earth and manifested in physical flesh and blood in the person of Jesus.   

We will attempt to boil love down to its essence, to its simplest form, so we can define what perfect love is in the context of the human existence, so that we can properly respond to God's invitation to participate in the divine love of the Trinity.   

We will start with observing the outward actions that Jesus equated with love, in an attempt to then discover what inner heart posture would be necessary to produce those outward actions, because the heart is where love exists. 

### 1. Obedience:  The Evidence of True Love

---

The Scriptures describe obedience as the litmus test of our love for God, because God desires us to love Him the same way Jesus loved Him. There is no other clearer evidence of love given in Scripture.

> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.  (1 John 5:2-3) 
>
> “If you love me, you will keep my commandments.” (John 14:15)
>
> “Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. (John 14:21)
>
> Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word…  Whoever does not love me does not keep my words.” (John 14:23-24)
>
> “You are my friends if you do what I command you.” (John 15:14)

And yet, obedience alone isn't true love.  When we see leaves blowing through the air, we know that the wind is holding them up in mid-air, but we don’t say that the leaves are the wind.  In the same way, obedience comes to life and swirls in the air around a person who has real Biblical love inside of them.   

There is an even higher expression of love.

### 2. Sacrificial Obedience:  The Ultimate Expression of Love

---

Likely the greatest, most direct, and easy to understand statment Jesus made about love was this:

> **Greater love has no one than this**, than to lay down one’s life for his friends. (John 15:13)

What Jesus is saying is that literally the greatest expression and fullest demonstration of love is sacrifice. To Jesus, the greater level of sacrifice, the greater love you have for them.  Jesus later went on to practice what he had preached in John 15:13 when he demonstrated the ultimate sacrificial obedience in the garden of Gethsemane the night before he went to the cross:

>  “Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me;* *Nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.” (Luke 22:42)*

There is no question that sacrificial obedience is truly the highest expression of God's perfect love.

### 3. Submission:  The Heart Posture that is Love

---

If obedience and especially sacrificial obedience are the highest expressions of love, we need to get to the root of where they originate, and what causes them to be displayed.  They are simply outward displays of an inner reality, a heart posture, of real love.  

Obedience and sacrifice do come from the same root, because they have one thing in common:

> Obedience and sacrifice are **done for someone else**. 

By definition, obeying is complying with **another person's** wishes, requests, or orders.  Sacrifice is doing something for **another person** that costs you something personally, whether money, time, effort, convenience, reputation, or you just don't like or even hate doing.

At their core, both of these actions require a heart posture of selflessness, putting the other person first, at least during that obedient or sacrificial act.   So is selflessness true love?  No.  While selflessness is a *pre-requisite* for obedience and sacrifice, there is something else that is deeper and more foundational.  

Our most powerful faculty as human beings is our will.  It rules over and governs all of our other faculties: our mind, emotions, and even the pressures exerted upon us by others.  To tame the will is the hardest thing.  Yes, we can be selfless to another person in varying degrees and often put their will ahead of ours on a temporary basis.  But can we always be selfless no matter what the cost?

This more powerful heart posture was displayed by Jesus when He said, 

> "Not my will, but yours be done."  (Luke 22:42)  

The word for this is:  **Submission**.  Submission is simply defined as:  

>  The absolute surrender of one's will to the will of another.

A metaphor that can be used to help understand these concepts is currency, because the expression of love (obedience and sacrifice) always costs you something.  Sacrifice can be thought of as obedience that has a high cost, and the greater the sacrifice, the greater the cost.  

The currency of love is selflessness.  If you do not have selflessness stored up in your heart, you cannot be obedient or sacrificial any more than you can buy a home if you don't have a job.   If you possess a certain measure of selflessness, you can express a certain level of love.   But like any currency, that amount is limited and finite.   

> For example, I may be selfless enough to switch a weekend shift with my co-worker who had a sudden family emergency, even though it cost me watching the Super Bowl.  But I may not be selfless enough to let their whole family move into my basement indefinately until they find a new home, because their house burned down and they need a place to stay.

Now, **absolute submission** can be thought of as being infintely wealthy, like a Jeff Besos.  Why?  Because by definition, submission (surrendering one's will completely to another) is the ultimate form of selflessness.  Why? Because if our will is completely surrendered to another, it would be literally impossible to choose self over the other person.  Absolute submission is the eptiomy and embodiment of selflessness.

`Therefore, absolute submission is the heart posture behind true love, the origin, the cause, and likely the truest definition of Biblical love that exists.`
