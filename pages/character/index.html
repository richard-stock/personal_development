</span></div></div><div class="post-content"><h3 id="a-principle-based-paradigm">A ‘Principle Based’ Paradigm</h3><hr /><p>The <em>Character Paradigm</em> is based on the fundamental idea that there are <strong>principles</strong> that govern human effectiveness—natural laws in the human dimension that are just as real, just as unchanging and unarguably “there” as laws such as gravity are in the physical dimension.</p><blockquote><p>Two battleships assigned to the training squadron had been at sea on maneuvers in heavy weather for several days. I was serving on the lead battleship and was on watch on the bridge as night fell.</p><p>The visibility was poor with patchy fog, so the captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on all activities.</p><p>Shortly after dark, the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported, “Light, bearing on the starboard bow.”</p><p>“Is it steady or moving astern?” the captain called out.</p><p>Lookout replied, “Steady, captain,” which meant we were on a dangerous collision course with that ship.</p><p>The captain then called to the signalman, “Signal that ship: We are on a collision course, advise you change course 20 degrees.”</p><p>Back came a signal, “Advisable for you to change course 20 degrees.”</p><p>The captain said, “Send, I’m a captain, change course 20 degrees.”</p><p>“I’m a seaman second class,” came the reply. “You had better change course 20 degrees.”</p><p>By that time, the captain was furious. He spat out, “Send, I’m a battleship. Change course 20 degrees.”</p><p>Back came the flashing light, “I’m a lighthouse.”</p><p>We changed course.</p></blockquote><p>Principles are like lighthouses. They are natural laws that cannot be broken. As Cecil B. DeMille observed of the principles contained in his monumental movie, The Ten Commandments,</p><blockquote><p>“It is impossible for us to break the law. We can only break ourselves against the law.”</p></blockquote><p>People view the world through the lens of their paradigms, but they are in terms they are a “subjective reality,” only an attempt to describe the territory.</p><p>The “objective reality,” or the territory itself, is composed of “lighthouse” principles that govern human growth and happiness—natural laws that are woven into the fabric of every civilized society throughout history and comprise the roots of every family and institution that has endured and prospered. The degree to which our mental maps accurately describe the territory does not alter its existence.</p><p>Principles are guidelines for human conduct that are proven to have enduring, permanent value. They’re fundamental. They’re essentially unarguable because they are self-evident. One way to quickly grasp the self evident nature of principles is to simply consider the absurdity of attempting to live an effective life based on their opposites. I doubt that anyone would seriously consider unfairness, deceit, baseness, uselessness, mediocrity, or degeneration to be a solid foundation for lasting happiness and success. Although people may argue about how these principles are defined or manifested or achieved, there seems to be an innate consciousness and awareness that they exist.</p><p>The more closely our maps or paradigms are aligned with these principles or natural laws, the more accurate and functional they will be. Correct maps will infinitely impact our personal and interpersonal effectiveness far more than any amount of effort expended on changing our attitudes and behaviours.</p><h3 id="an-inside-out-paradigm--focus-on-self-not-others">An ‘Inside Out’ Paradigm: Focus on Self, not Others</h3><hr /><blockquote><p>“Inside-out” means to <strong>start first with self</strong>; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self—<strong>with your paradigms, your character, and your motives</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>It says:</p><ul><li>if you want to have a happy <em>marriage</em>, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it.</li><li>If you want to have a more pleasant, cooperative <em>teenager</em>, be a more understanding, empathic, consistent, loving parent.</li><li>If you want to have more <em>freedom</em>, more latitude in your job, be a more responsible, a more helpful, a more contributing employee.</li><li>If you want to be <em>trusted</em>, be trustworthy.</li><li>If you want the secondary greatness of <em>recognized talent</em>, focus first on primary greatness of character.</li></ul><blockquote><p>The inside-out approach says that private victories precede public victories, that making and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others. <strong>It says it is futile to put personality ahead of character, to try to improve relationships with others before improving ourselves.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I have had the opportunity to work with many people—wonderful people, talented people, people who deeply want to achieve happiness and success, people who are searching, people who are hurting. I’ve worked with business executives, college students, church and civic groups, families and marriage partners. And in all of my experience, <strong>I have never seen lasting solutions to problems, lasting happiness and success, that came from the outside in</strong>.</p><p>What I have seen result from the outside-in paradigm is unhappy people who feel victimized and immobilized, who focus on the weaknesses of other people and the circumstances they feel are responsible for their own stagnant situation. I’ve seen unhappy marriages where each spouse wants the other to change, where each is confessing the other’s “sins,” where each is trying to shape up the other.</p><p>Inside-out is a process—a continuing process of renewal based on the natural laws that govern human growth and progress. It’s an upward spiral of growth that leads to progressively higher forms of responsible independence and effective interdependence.</p><h3 id="there-are-no-shortcuts-to-character-development">There are No Shortcuts to Character Development</h3><hr /><p>In all of life, there are sequential stages of growth and development. A child learns to turn over, to sit up, to crawl, and then to walk and run. Each step is important and each one takes time. No step can be skipped.</p><p>This is true in all phases of life, in all areas of development, whether it be learning to play the piano or communicate effectively with a working associate. It is true with individuals, with marriages, with families, and with organizations.</p><p>We know and accept this fact or principle of process in the area of physical things, but to understand it in emotional areas, in human relations, and even in the area of personal character is less common and more difficult. And even if we understand it, to accept it and to live in harmony with it are even less common and more difficult. Consequently, we sometimes look for a shortcut, expecting to be able to skip some of these vital steps in order to save time and effort and still reap the desired result.</p><p>But what happens when we attempt to shortcut a natural process in our growth and development? If you are only an average tennis player but decide to play at a higher level in order to make a better impression, what will result? Would positive thinking alone enable you to compete effectively against a professional?</p><p>Our level of development is fairly obvious with tennis or piano playing, where it is impossible to pretend. But it is not so obvious in the areas of character and emotional development. We can “pose” and “put on” for a stranger or an associate. We can pretend. And for a while we can get by with it—at least in public. We might even deceive ourselves. Yet I believe that most of us know the truth of what we really are inside; and I think many of those we live with and work with do as well.</p><p>People are intrigued when they see good things happening in the lives of individuals, families, and organizations that are based on solid principles. They admire such personal strength and maturity, such family unity and teamwork, such adaptive synergistic organizational culture.</p><p>And their immediate request is very revealing of their basic paradigm.</p><p>“How do you do it? Teach me the techniques.” What they’re really saying is, “Give me some quick fix advice or solution that will relieve the pain in my own situation.”</p><p>They will find people who will meet their wants and teach these things; and for a short time, skills and techniques may appear to work. They may eliminate some of the cosmetic or acute problems through social aspirin and Band-Aids.</p><p>But the underlying chronic condition remains, and eventually new acute symptoms will appear. The more people are into quick fix and focus on the acute problems and pain, the more that very approach contributes to the underlying chronic condition.</p><p>The Personality Paradigm tells me there must be something out there—some new planner or seminar that will help me handle all these pressures in a more efficient way.</p><p>But is there a chance that efficiency is not the answer? Is getting more things done in less time going to make a difference—or will it just increase the pace at which I react to the people and circumstances that seem to control my life?</p><p>Could there be something I need to see in a deeper, more fundamental way —some paradigm within myself that affects the way I see my time, my life, and my own nature? Is it possible that my spouse, my job, my friends, my circumstances aren’t the real problem? Could I be the problem? Could the way I view reality be the problem?</p><h3 id="we-need-a-paradigm-shift">We Need A Paradigm Shift</h3><hr /><p>Albert Einstein observed,</p><blockquote><p>“The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.”</p></blockquote><p>As we look around us and within us and recognize the problems created as we live and interact within the Personality Development Paradigm, we begin to realize that these are deep, fundamental problems that cannot be solved on the superficial level on which they were created.</p><p>“Inside-out” is a dramatic paradigm shift for most people, largely because of the powerful impact of conditioning and the current social paradigm of the Personality Paradigm. But we need a new level, a deeper level of thinking - the Character Development Paradigm - based on the principles that accurately describe the reality of effective human being and interacting - to solve these deep concerns.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><!-- Post sharing snippet v2.1 https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy © 2019 Cotes Chung Published under the MIT License --><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The Character Development Paradigm - Richard & Rebeca Stock&url=https://richard-stock.github.io/personal_development/pages/character/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=The Character Development Paradigm - Richard & Rebeca Stock&u=https://richard-stock.github.io/personal_development/pages/character/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share?text=The Character Development Paradigm - Richard & Rebeca Stock&url=https://richard-stock.github.io/personal_development/pages/character/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" onclick="copyLink()" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link"></i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><!-- The Pannel on right side (Desktop views) v2.0 https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy © 2017-2019 Cotes Chung MIT License --><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="post-extend-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"> <!-- Recommend the other 3 posts according to the tags and categories of the current post, if the number is not enough, use the other latest posts to supplement. v2.0 https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy © 2019 Cotes Chung Published under the MIT License --> <!-- Navigation buttons at the bottom of the post. v2.1 https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy © 2020 Cotes Chung MIT License --><div class="post-navigation d-flex justify-content-between"> <span class="btn btn-outline-primary disabled"><p>-</p></span> <span class="btn btn-outline-primary disabled"><p>-</p></span></div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lozad/dist/lozad.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> const imgs = document.querySelectorAll('#post-wrapper img');
