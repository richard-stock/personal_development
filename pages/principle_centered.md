### Lighthouse Principles:  Objective Reality 
---

The fundamental idea that there are principles that govern human effectiveness—natural laws in the human dimension that are just as real, just as unchanging and unarguably “there” as laws such as gravity are in the physical dimension.

> Two battleships assigned to the training squadron had been at sea on maneuvers in heavy weather for several days. I was serving on the lead battleship and was on watch on the bridge as night fell.
>
> The visibility was poor with patchy fog, so the captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on all activities.
>
> Shortly after dark, the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported, “Light, bearing on the starboard bow.”
>
> “Is it steady or moving astern?” the captain called out.
>
> Lookout replied, “Steady, captain,” which meant we were on a dangerous collision course with that ship.
>
> The captain then called to the signalman, “Signal that ship: We are on a collision course, advise you change course 20 degrees.”
>
> Back came a signal, “Advisable for you to change course 20 degrees.”
>
> The captain said, “Send, I’m a captain, change course 20 degrees.”
>
> “I’m a seaman second class,” came the reply. “You had better change course 20 degrees.”
>
> By that time, the captain was furious. He spat out, “Send, I’m a battleship. Change course 20 degrees.”
>
> Back came the flashing light, “I’m a lighthouse.”
>
> We changed course.

Principles are like lighthouses. They are natural laws that cannot be broken. As Cecil B. DeMille observed of the principles contained in his monumental movie, The Ten Commandments, 

>  “It is impossible for us to break the law. We can only break ourselves against the law.”

People view the world through the lens of their paradigms, but they are  in terms they are a “subjective reality,” only an attempt to describe the territory.

The “objective reality,” or the territory itself, is composed of “lighthouse”
principles that govern human growth and happiness—natural laws that are
woven into the fabric of every civilized society throughout history and
comprise the roots of every family and institution that has endured and
prospered. The degree to which our mental maps accurately describe the
territory does not alter its existence.

Principles are guidelines for human conduct that are proven to have
enduring, permanent value. They’re fundamental. They’re essentially
unarguable because they are self-evident. One way to quickly grasp the self evident nature of principles is to simply consider the absurdity of attempting
to live an effective life based on their opposites. I doubt that anyone would
seriously consider unfairness, deceit, baseness, uselessness, mediocrity, or
degeneration to be a solid foundation for lasting happiness and success.
Although people may argue about how these principles are defined or
manifested or achieved, there seems to be an innate consciousness and
awareness that they exist.

The more closely our maps or paradigms are aligned with these principles
or natural laws, the more accurate and functional they will be. Correct maps
will infinitely impact our personal and interpersonal effectiveness far more
than any amount of effort expended on changing our attitudes and behaviors.
