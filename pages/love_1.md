### Principle # 1:  Love is Uncreated
---
Love has already been in existance for all eternity past, in the heart of God.  This is because God is love.  Since God is eternal, love is eternal.  
> He who does not love does not know God, **for God is love**. (1 John 4:8)

This means that love existed before humans did.  The Father loved his only son Jesus before the visible universe that we know was created.  Where did this ancient love exist?  It existed between the 3 members of the Trinity.   The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spririt have always loved each other fully and perfectly, dwelling in perfect unity together.
> “Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me; **for You loved Me before the foundation of the world**. (John 17:24)

Forever and ever, far before the foundation of the world, love has been abounding and expressed fully and perfectly in the heart of God.   God was perfectly happy and full of love within Himself.  

### Principle # 2:  Love is the Reason Man was Created
---
In fact, it was out of a desire to share His perfect love that God even created man.  **God created man for the sole purpose of being able to experience and participate in His love.**  God loved us before we were created.  This is an incredible reality that is hard for us to fully grasp. 

> We love Him because He first loved us.  (1 John 4:19)

We as humans only know HOW to love because we are created FOR love.  

`Therefore, love is the highest expression and quality of life.  To love is simply to respond to God’s invitation to take part in the divine expression of love that has always existed in his Heart, forever.`
